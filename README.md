## Introduction

**GPT Image Describer** is a Python-based tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT model to automatically generate SEO-optimized titles and keywords for your photos. This project is designed for quick personal use and is not intended for production environments.

---

## Features

- Generates SEO-friendly titles and keywords for images.
- Supports popular image formats such as JPG, JPEG, and PNG.
- Automatically adds metadata to the images.
- Handles images from a specified source folder and saves the processed images to a destination folder.

---

## Installation

1. **Save the Script**: Save the script as `images_describer.py`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Get OpenAI API Key**: Obtain your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/). Save the key in a file named `openai_key.txt` in the same directory as your script. **Keep this key secret and do not share it!**

---

## Usage

Run the script from your command line, specifying the source folder containing your images. Optionally, you can specify a destination folder for the processed images.

```bash
python images_describer.py [source folder] [optional destination]
```

### Example

```bash
python images_describer.py /mypics /modified
```

In this example, images from the `/mypics` folder will be processed, and the resulting images will be saved in the `/modified` folder.

---

## Configuration

Create a `configurations.txt` file in the same directory as `images_describer.py`. This file should contain the necessary settings for handling images. Hereâ€™s a template:

```plaintext
prompt=Describe the image and generate a title and keywords.
source_folder=/path/to/your/source/folder
destination_folder=/path/to/your/destination/folder
author=Your Name
```

- **prompt**: A prompt for generating titles, descriptions, and keywords using ChatGPT.
- **source_folder**: The folder where your images are located.
- **destination_folder**: The folder where the processed images will be saved. If not provided, images will be saved back to the source folder.
- **author**: The name of the image's author or creator.

## Additional Notes

- **Source Folder**: Ensure that the source folder contains only the images you want to process. The script will process all files with supported extensions.
- **Destination Folder**: If no destination folder is specified, the processed images will be saved back in the source folder, overwriting the original files.
- **Image Metadata**: The script uses the "ImageDescription" metadata field to store the generated titles and keywords.
- **Free OpenAI Tier**: Be aware that the free tier of OpenAI may have limitations on the number of requests you can make.
